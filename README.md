# Meme Market

#### About Meme Market
Founded in 2017, Meme Market is the premiere store
for your meme-themed beverage containers in the West
Tennessee Area. Our owner, Gazzy Garcia, has
been a driving force in the improvement of meme-imprinted drinking mugs,
bottles, and canteens. In order to keep up with the competition, Mr. Garcia has
requested the help of Butyl Group to create a proprietary tool for managing
his company's database. Whether it be the inventory within the warehouse or a
delivery that needs to be made, Butyl Group act as the fulcrum of the 
entire operation.

#### About Butyl Group
Butyl Group is a team of programmers from the esteemed Madison Academic High
School. The three team members are Robert Yin, Bryce Worley, and Eli Parker.
For this project, the team members have all taken different roles in order 
to achieve our project needs. Eli has been assigned as one of our front-end 
developers, meaning that he will assist in testing and creating our employee
interface. Bryce has been assigned the role of back-end developer/database
manager, so he will be creating and managing our SQL database. Robert will act
as a combination of a full-stack developer and a project manager. He will
rotate between front-end development, back-end management, and project
management.

#### About Our Product

Butyl Group has designed a proprietary website for Meme Mugs employees
to use for managing database information. The employee will be able to 
access these five pages: Orders, Deliveries, Inventory, Customers, and
Employees. We will be using html and css to style the pages, phpMyAdmin
for database management, and php to connect the front-end and back-end.
We expect the employee to use our product on either a Windows desktop, laptop,
or medium to large tablet. While it may possibly scale on a smaller
device, we will not be expecting for anyone to use it on a smaller
screen. Also, while it is fully functional in all browsers, we have truly 
optimized the user experience for Google Chrome.
